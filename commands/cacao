    message.channel.send('Cacao (カカオ Kakao) is a character debuting and currently exclusive to the Nekopara anime series. She was found as a stray by Chocola, and was eventually adopted by Kashou and Shigure as the newest member of the Minaduki catgirls. There is currently no news stating that she will appear in any other media.')
    message.channel.send('**Appearance**')
    message.channel.send('Cacao has mint-colored short hair that hangs freely, not held up by ribbons or bows like the rest of the girls, besides Coconut. Being the youngest of catgirls, she is also the shortest, going up to Chocola middle.')
    message.channel.send('Cacao is rarely seen without her signature hat, which is tan and brown with a small orange bow decoration on the bill, alongside room for her ears. She wears a white blouse, underneath a pair of overall shorts; decorated with orange bows, a pink heart-shaped pin, and an orange ribbon tied into a bow, acting as a belt.')
    message.channel.send('**Personality**')
    message.channel.send('From her debut in the anime, Cacao behaves very much like a newborn child; hardly acting or reacting with any emotion. Cacao rarely speaks, and when she does, it is typically short words or sentences. Despite these things, she seems to care fondly for the Minaduki family; with an especially close bond to Chocola.')

    message.channel.send('Cacao does not appear anywhere in the Visual Novel editions of Nekopara as of now, hence the exclusivity mentioned at the top of this page.')
